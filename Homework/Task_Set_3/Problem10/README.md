# Kronecker Product Research

Kronecker Product
	The Kronecker product of two matrices of any size result in a bigger matrix.
The Kronecker product is very used when optimizing a function where we donâ€™t know the matrix. It is also used in studying distribution of test statics in ANOVA. Doing the Kronecker product help solving equations such as: AX + XB = C. Same with teh Lyapunov Equation.
