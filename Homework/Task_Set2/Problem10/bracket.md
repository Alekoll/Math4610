# Bracketing Roots References
 
 A root is bracketed if the interval (a,b) if f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. In this same refernce it gives examples on how to bracket NonLinear sets. [source](http://www.aip.de/groups/soe/local/numres/bookcpdf/c9-1.pdf)
 
 One method is known as the false position method, also known as linear interpolations method. Determine the next guess by connecting the endpoints with a straight line and determine the locaiton of the intercept of the straight line [source](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.720.8609&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
 
 Brent's Method: root-find which combines root bracketing, bisection, and inverse quadratic interpolation. [source](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BrentsMethod.html)
