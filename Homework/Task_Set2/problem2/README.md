### Description:
in the numerical solution of differential equations, the approximation above is used quite often. Write code that implements this approximation for various values of the paramter 
h. Use the routine you create, along with the code for the relative and absolute error, to investigate this approximation as 
h tends to zero. Graph the results starting with h = 1 and then dividing h by two until the approximation fails to get better.
