# Mitigating Problems by Modifying Equations

## Part A
  
  f(x) = sqrt(x) use the derivative approximation as h -> 0. Then use the conjugate of the numerator to rewrite formula.
  
  ### Results
  
  [The Results](https://github.com/Alekoll/Math4610/blob/master/routines/TestApprox3.pdf) show that the conjugate will continue to approach 0 while the approximate will have a change of heart and go the other way.

## Part B
  
  Approximate the derivative of f(x) = sin(x) where x0 = 0 as h -> 0. Reevaluate the sin(x) by using Taylor series expansion. The computational difference can be found [here](https://github.com/Alekoll/Math4610/blob/master/routines/TestApprox3b.pdf)
