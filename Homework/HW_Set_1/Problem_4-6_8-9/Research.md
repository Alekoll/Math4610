# Machine Precision Influence
  by Alex
  Machine epsilon is the upper bound of the relative error due to rounding in floating point arithmetic. In 1991 28 Americans died when the patriot defense system failed due to rounding error. The clock cycle of 1/10 seconds had an error of 9.5 X 10^8 seconds. Over time the battery that was running for 100 hrs consecutively caused an inaccuary of .342 seconds which shifted the range system. The target was considered 137 meters out of range. Rounding has caused deaths.
